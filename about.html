        <p> My name is Stephen Lynch. A former certified arborist, 
        I am a graduate of Bristol County Agricultural High School 
        and the Stockbridge School of Agriculture at the University 
        of Massachusetts. Having always promoted native plants, 
        in 1993 I started my company, Mirage Water Gardens to explore 
        the propagation and use of our native aquatic and wetland species. 
        For the past thirty years I have created native wetland habitats 
        and have also planted and observed terrestrial native plants in 
        various locations. </p>

        <p> In addition to collecting plants, I am also a birder. When I 
        purchased my one acre property in South Sandwich, it was a mostly 
        wooded site and had a very small bird population. As a result of 
        my intervention of selective tree removal and habitat diversification 
        by replanting a wide range of native and non native plants, I have 
        recorded, as of February 2023, eighty-five different species of birds 
        in my yard. </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p> This replanting includes a large number of plants from the genus 
        Hamamelis, commonly known as Witch Hazel. These are small trees or 
        large shrubs in a typical range of 10 to 20 feet tall. They bloom 
        in cold weather with narrow, strap-like petals in the yellow to red 
        spectrum. Starting in late September, our native species begins to 
        bloom. Following them are a wide selection of mostly Asian cultivars 
        that pass the flowering torch all the way to early April. With over 
        twenty blooming age specimens in my collection, I have achieved a 
        personal goal of continuous year round bloom. These flowers provide 
        food for our native flower flies. Beginning on Christmas Day 2015, 
        I have not experienced a single day without something in bloom in my 
        yard. To have a collection as large as this is very cool indeed, 
        but the goal of flowers from fall to spring can be achieved with as 
        few as five or six different Witch Hazels. </p>

        <p> Another interest of mine is rearing butterflies from caterpillars. 
        The iconic monarch is relatively easy to accommodate in the adult stage. 
        However, as most know, the caterpillars only eat species of milkweed. 
        To have a complete generational life cycle take place in your yard, 
        you need to grow local milkweed which is also a valuable pollen and 
        nectar source. The adults will find and lay eggs on your plants, and 
        with a little luck they hatch and grow to adults, completing the 
        generation. Monarchs have predators at every stage of their life. 
        I have read of survival rates as low as 1% to 2%, so I collect the eggs. 
        In 2022, I reared and released 162 Monarchs from multiple generations. 
        Fourteen of those were what I call the Mex/Gen Monarchs. These lucky 
        ones get to fly all the way back to Mexico. In collaboration with 
        Monarch Watch at the University of Kansas, I tagged these Mex/Gen 
        miracles and sent them on their way. On Cape Cod, the adults of this 
        critical generation emerge in mid October. At this time, food sources 
        for butterflies are becoming scarce. With this in mind, some of the 
        asters and goldenrods I am offering are among the latest blooming 
        plants on the Cape. These plants combined with a nice selection of 
        milkweed, will help your yard become a stepping stone in the precarious 
        life cycle of the monarch. </p>

        <p> Searching for a name more descriptive of my goal of supporting native 
        plants and pollinators, I am moving forward as Solidago Native Plants. 
        Solidago is the genus for goldenrod and in Latin means to make whole.

        Imagine if butterflies could feed yard to yard instead of searching for 
        food or a place to lay eggs. Every yard has room for a few natives. </p>
